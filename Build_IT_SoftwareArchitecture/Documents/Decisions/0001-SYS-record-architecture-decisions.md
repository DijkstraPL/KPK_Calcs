# ADR start working on proper decision documentation

Due to going along with the DNA course, I decided to add some ADRs (Architectural Decision Records) during the work on this project.

* **Issue**: I don't have a single place where I could add documentation about all of mine decisions.

* **Decision**: Add new folder where I can add and find all previous decision documents with appropriate comments.

* **Status**: Done.

* **Group**: Documentation.

* **Assumptions**: Could be done easily.

* **Constraints**: None.

* **Positions**: Adding those kind of decision to another web portal such as Asana, Trelo or GitHub.

* **Argument**: It is better to have it close to the code.

* **Implications**: None.

* **Related decisions**: None.

* **Related requirements**: None.

* **Related artifacts**: None.

* **Related principles**: None.

* **Date**: 2019-09-26

* **Notes**: None.
