<h3>Overall informations</h3>
<p>
    The site contains a large number of calculators
    which based mostly on Eurocodes with Polish national annexes.

        <h3>@Html.ActionLink("Snow load calculator", "Calculator", "SnowLoads")</h3>
        <p>
            Mostly based on <i>Eurocode 1 - Actions on structures Part 1-3: General actions - Snow loads</i> with Polish national annex.
            This calculator contains all possible design situations and roof types which are described in the document.
            This calculators shouldn't be used for or doesn't have informations how to calculate:
            <ul>
                <li>sites at altitudes above 1 500m,</li>
                <li>impact snow loads resulting from sliding off or falling from a higher roof,</li>
                <li>additional wind loads which could result from changes in shape or size of the construction works due to the presence of snow or the accretion of ice,</li>
                <li>loads in areas where snow is present all year round,</li>
                <li>ice loading,</li>
                <li>lateral loading due to snow (e.g. lateral loads exerted by drifts),</li>
                <li>snow loads on bridges.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>@Html.ActionLink("Dead load calculator", "DeadLoadCalculator", "DeadLoads")</h3>
        <p>
            Mostly based on <i>Eurocode 1 - Actions on structures Part 1-1: General actions - Densities, self-weight, imposed loads for buildings</i> with Polish national annex
            and on Polish standard document <i>PN-82/B-02001 Building loads - permanent loads</i> which contains informations about the density of the building materials.
            This calculator allows us to get the information about the weight of all layers in the structure.

<p>
    I am graduate of the technical university in Łódź at the faculty of Civil Engineering.
    Currently, I am also a student of Polish Academy of Science and work for building company as a programmer since the beginning of March 2017.
    I treat building designing with great passion the same as the programming.
    This way of doing things and possibilities which comes with those two branches bring me an idea to make something for overall usage.
    I started working on this site since May 2018 and I hope that there will be only more and better content available for everyone.
